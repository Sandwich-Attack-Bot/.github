## üåê What is Sandwich Bot?

**Sandwich Bot** is a high-frequency, fully automated crypto bot specifically built for executing **sandwich attacks** on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This advanced trading bot monitors blockchain mempools in real time, identifying large or impactful pending trades and strategically places transactions before and after them, creating a profit opportunity by manipulating the transaction order in a block.

Sandwich attacks are a sophisticated form of **Miner Extractable Value (MEV)** strategy where the bot "front-runs" a large trade by buying before it and then "back-runs" by selling after the trade executes, profiting from the price slippage created by the original transaction. This bot is optimized for blockchains like **Ethereum**, **Binance Smart Chain**, **Polygon**, and other EVM-compatible networks where mempool visibility and quick execution are key.

The Sandwich Bot is designed for **low latency execution**, deploying transactions with gas optimization to ensure priority in block inclusion. It integrates with **Flashbots** and other private transaction relays to reduce the risk of being front-run by competing bots. The bot also features an adaptive profit threshold system that automatically filters out unprofitable or high-risk trades, ensuring efficient capital usage.

With modular architecture and full open-source transparency, Sandwich Bot offers flexibility to customize key parameters such as:
- Slippage tolerance
- Minimum trade size
- Target token pairs
- Gas price strategies
- Blockchain network configuration

This solution is ideal for on-chain traders looking for **consistent daily profits** by utilizing advanced front-running strategies. It requires no manual intervention once deployed and can run indefinitely on dedicated servers or cloud environments.

Main Features:
- üöÄ Real-time mempool monitoring for sandwich opportunities
